# mp-MILP
Play area as I formulate the mp-MILP model for the scehduling problem. The goal is to have an MILP formulation for the probem and try to get lower bounds than those we currently have and additionally explore paremeterising the formulation as time goes on.

## Files
#### modelDuplex.py
 Contains a formulation of the constraints for duplex jobs. 

#### model.py
 Contains a formulation of the constraints for different classes of jobs. Definition for duplex jobs is all but done while the more general definition (to also handle mixed-plexity jobs) is still a work in progress.
 
#### Sched.lp
 Model definfition for test input

#### document
 Contains the latex file containing the mathematical definition of the constraints. pdf can be viewed at main.pdf
